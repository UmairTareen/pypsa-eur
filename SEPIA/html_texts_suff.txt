CO2_emissions_sector: <p> This plot shows the CO2 emissions for each sector and planning horizon starting from 2020 to end of transition period in 2050.</p>

It shows thats:

- The gross of the emission decrease happens in the early years of the transition, which is obtained, among others, by a rapid transformation and electrification of the transportation and space heating sectors.
- By 2050, the largest part of the emissions comes from the industry, due to the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g. for xxx) and to the process-related emissions (e.g. in the cement clinker calcination process)
- Negative emissions mainly happen through biomass capture of CO2. This capture however decreases from 2040 to 2050 because of xxx. The captured CO2 by biomass is re-emitted when this biomass is exploited, e.g. in industry of for space heating in the residential and tertiary sectors xxxcheck).
- The emissions from industrial processes are almost completely removed by 2030 which is due to xxxxxx
- No negative emissions from carbon capture are present. This is because sequestration is not allowed in the sufficiency scenario, contrary to carbon capture and utilization (CCU), which is assumed to reduce or cancel the process emissions, but not to generated negative emissions. xxxcheck

  It shows that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The majority of emission reductions occur in the early years of the transition, primarily driven by the rapid electrification of transportation and space heating.</li>
  <li>By 2050, most remaining emissions come from the industrial sector due to the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g., for high-temperature processes xxxcheck) and process-related emissions, such as those from cement clinker calcination.</li>
  <li>Negative emissions mainly result from biomass-based CO₂ capture. However, this capture declines between 2040 and 2050 due to limitations in biomass availability and sustainability concerns. The CO₂ absorbed by biomass is eventually re-released when the biomass is utilized, for example, in industrial applications or space heating in the residential and tertiary sectors. xxxcheck</li>
  <li>Industrial process emissions are almost entirely eliminated by 2030, largely due to technological advancements and fuel switching. xxxxcheck</li>
  <li>No negative emissions from carbon sequestration are present, as sequestration is not permitted in the sufficiency scenario. However, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is assumed to mitigate or neutralize process emissions without generating net negative emissions. xxxxxx</li>
</ul>


CO2_emissions_source: <p> This plot shows the CO2 emissions for each source and planning horizon starting from 2020 to end of transition period in 2050.</p>

<p>
  It clearly indicates that the reduction in emissions is closely linked to the decline in petroleum and natural gas imports. In contrast, other sources of emissions, such as those from agriculture, have a lower potential for reduction.
