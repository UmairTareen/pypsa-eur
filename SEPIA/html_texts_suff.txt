CO2_emissions_sector: <p> This plot shows the CO2 emissions for each sector and planning horizon starting from 2020 to end of transition period in 2050.</p> <p> It shows that: </p> <ul> <li>The majority of emission reductions occur in the early years of the transition, primarily driven by the rapid electrification of transportation and space heating.</li> <li>By 2050, most remaining emissions come from the industrial sector due to the usage of fossil fuels (e.g., for high-temperature processes and chemical indusry) and process-related emissions, such as those from cement clinker calcination.</li> <li>Negative emissions mainly result from biomass-based CO₂ capture. However, this capture declines between 2040 and 2050 due to limitations in biomass availability and sustainability concerns. The CO₂ absorbed by biomass is eventually re-released when the biomass is utilized, for example, in industrial applications or producing bio fuels or space heating in the residential and tertiary sectors. </li> <li>Industrial process emissions directly in the atmosphere are almost entirely eliminated by 2030, largely due to post combustion carbon capture applications.</li> <li>No negative emissions from carbon sequestration are present, as sequestration is not permitted in the sufficiency scenario. However, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is assumed to mitigate or neutralize process emissions without generating net negative emissions, as it is totally utilised to produce synthetic oils and methanol. xxxxxx</li> </ul>


CO2_emissions_source: <p> This plot shows the CO2 emissions for each source and planning horizon starting from 2020 to end of transition period in 2050.</p><p>  It clearly indicates that the reduction in emissions is closely linked to the decline in petroleum and natural gas imports. In contrast, other sources of emissions, such as those from agriculture, have a lower potential for reduction.</p>

sankey_diagram: <p> The sankey diagram illustrates the energy flows and conversion from primary energy sources to final energy demands. It can be displayed for each simulated time period (2020, 2030, 2040, 2050).</p> <p>Some key insights from the Sankey diagrams include:</p><ul><li>Belgium increases its energy independence to 60%, up from about 20% today.</li><li>Renewable electricity is primarily produced locally.</li><li>Biomass consumption slightly increases and is fully utilized up to its maximum potential.</li><li>Biomass is the primary source of methane for the gas grid, produced via biogas from wet biomass and methanation from dry biomass. </li><li>  The gas grid remains but is almost exclusively used for industry. Residential and tertiary distribution gas grids become obsolete and are gradually decommissioned.</li><li>Imports and energy dependency mainly involve green hydrogen, supplied via a pan-European hydrogen backbone.</li><li>This hydrogen is used for non-energy demands and international shipping, amounting to 86 TWh in the sufficiency scenario.</li><li>Electricity becomes the dominant energy vector, carrying 165 TWh in 2050 compared to 80 TWh in 2020.</li><li>Battery electric vehicles dominate, except for long-distance freight. Their electricity consumption reaches 17 TWh in 2050.</li><li>Low-temperature heat is primarily supplied by heat pumps, with a small contribution from biomass. About 25% is district heating, incorporating thermal energy storage to enable load shifting.</li></ul>

carbon_sankey_diagram: <p> The carbon sankey diagram illustrates the carbon flow (expressed in tons of CO2) for each source and sector. It can be displayed for each simulated time period (2020, 2030, 2040, 2050).</p><p>Although the simulated region (Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK) achieves full carbon neutrality by 2050, Belgium is allowed a residual net emission of 5% compared to 1990 levels. Due to the limited carbon sink potential of the Belgian territory (LULUCF), it is more practical to allocate these residual emissions to neighboring countries with greater capacity.</p> <p>The carbon Sankey also reveals that:</p><ul><li>All process emissions are captured and utilized to produce e-fuels (synthetic oil and methanol), which are later re-emitted.</li><li>A significant and challenging source of carbon emissions comes from the agriculture sector, which is expected to reduce its emissions from 10 Mton in 2020 to 5 Mton in 2050.</li><li>Some emissions are embedded in the import and export of synthetic fuels: imported methanol contributes to positive emissions, while exported bio-sourced natural gas accounts for negative emissions.</li></ul>

sectoral_demands_desc: <p>This figure displays the final and energy and non-energy demands for each carrier and across different sectors.</p> <p>Due to efficiency improvements in final energy conversion technologies and the sufficiency assumptions, it is evident that many of these demands decrease over time:</p><ul><li>Fossil fuel-based feedstocks for industry are reduced and gradually replaced by hydrogen starting in 2040.</li><li> Low temperature space heating declines due to deep renovations and improved building energy efficiency. By 2050, district heating covers 25% of the demand.</li><li>Final electricity demand rises, driven by the electrification of transportation and industrial processes.</li><li>Oil demand sharply decreases, with a residual 4 TWh for aviation in 2050.</li><li>Gas use in industry also decreases, with a portion replaced by electricity.</li><li>Hydrogen is consumed for production of feedstocks, ammonia and steel in indutrial sectors and also as a fuel in domestic and maritime transport. Its share in final energy demand remains relatively low, confirming its main role as an intermediate (secondary) energy carrier.</li><li>Solid biomass remains relatively stable and is used for high-temperature heat in industry.</li></ul>

annual_costs_desc: <p>The total annual costs include investment (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenses. While CAPEX remains relatively stable in time, OPEX is significantly reduced, mainly because of the decreased importations of fossil fuels.</p> 

investment_costs_desc: <p>The annual investment costs are annualized and don't necessarily represent the invesments to be realized in the given time period. This appears clearly for the nuclear techology: annualized invesment cost are displayed for 2020 and 2030 while no investment in new nuclear units is foreseen in the scenario. </p><p>The following technologies also deserve specific attention:</p><ul><li>Biogas is deployed as early as 2030, while BioSNG (methanation of dry biomass) gains significance by 2040.</li><li>Substantial investments in heat pumps are required throughout the entire energy transition.</li><li>Investment in power-to-gas technologies steadily increases from 2030 to 2050.</li><li>The investment in grids and interconnections (both AC and DC) amounts to xxxxx, remaining lower than the annual investment needed for distribution grids xxxxxprevious_explanation_not_convincing</li><li>Major investments are necessary for solar and wind power generation technologies, reaching about 37% of the total required investment cost by 2050.</li></ul>


capacities_desc: <p>The evolution of installed capacities is shown for several key technologies.</p> <p>The deployment of solar includes both rooftop and ground-mounted installations, reaching 22 GWp by 2030 and 44 GWp by 2050—still below the country's maximum potential.</p> <p>Offshore wind reaches its maximum potential of 8 GW by 2040. Notably, this scenario does not account for unlocking additional offshore capacity as proposed in the Ostend Declaration.</p> <p>AC and DC grid interconnections with neighboring countries more than double by 2050, enabling greater flexibility for integrating variable renewable energy sources.</p> <p>New gas power plants (CCGT) are installed by 2030 to meet the additional demand from electrification. These plants serve as a transitional solution, later replaced by further renewable energy deployment. Nuclear power is phased out according to the decommissioning plan for Doel and Tihange. By 2030, only Doel 4 and Tihange 3 remain operational. By 2040, no nuclear units are left in the country, and the model does not select new investments due to their prohibitive costs.</p>

storage_capacities_desc: <p>The storage capacitiy strongly varies depending on the energy carrier.</p> <ul><li>The gas storage capacity remains constant at 7.6 TWh, corresponding to the Loenhout storage facility. It is the only technology enabling seasonal storage in the country. Although the model allows its conversion into hydrogen storage (with lower capacity), it remains dedicated to natural gas throughout the transition, with no significant investments in hydrogen storage.</li><li>Battery storage emerges as early as 2030, primarily driven by the adoption of V2G technology. Grid-scale batteries are also deployed around 2040 to support grid balancing.</li><li>Thermal energy storage is introduced alongside the expansion of district heating networks, providing significant grid flexibility through load shifting. xxxx</li></ul>
