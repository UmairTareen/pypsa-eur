    <h1 class="main-title">The Negawatt Belgium Scenario</h1>
    <p class="mb-6">As Belgium faces the challenge of transitioning to a sustainable energy future, understanding different possible pathways becomes increasingly important. This study presents two contrasting scenarios for Belgium's energy transition towards 2050: a Reference scenario and an innovative Sufficiency scenario. Both scenarios aim to achieve a 95% reduction in emissions for Belgium while ensuring net-zero emissions across the broader regional context. These scenarios were developed using the comprehensive PyPSA-Eur model, which provides detailed modeling of electricity and gas networks, industrial demands, and cross-border energy exchanges. The analysis takes into account various factors including renewable energy potential, energy storage capabilities, and the evolution of different sectors such as industry, buildings, and transport.</p>

            <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Sufficiency Scenario</h5>
            <p class="mb-4">The Sufficiency scenario represents a transformative approach that prioritizes reduced energy consumption and sustainable practices. Key features include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li class="mb-2">54% reduction in final energy consumption compared to 2015</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Higher building renovation rate (3% per year)</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Increased focus on electrification and renewable energy</li>
                <li class="mb-2">No reliance on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)</li>
                <li class="mb-2">25% district heating deployment</li>
                <li class="mb-2">33% lower total system costs compared to Reference</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h5 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Reference Scenario</h5>
            <p class="mb-4">The Reference scenario represents a more conventional approach to energy transition. Key features include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li class="mb-2">Maintains 2020 demand levels</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Lower renovation rate (1% per year)</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Relies on Carbon Capture and Storage technologies</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Limited district heating deployment</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Higher proportion of primary steel production (60%)</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Greater reliance on Direct Air Capture for emissions reduction</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700">Both scenarios demonstrate that a transition to a renewable energy system is feasible for Belgium, with the Sufficiency scenario offering additional benefits in terms of cost reduction, energy independence, and environmental impact. </p>
