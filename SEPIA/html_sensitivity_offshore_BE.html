    <h1 class="main-title">Sensitivity Scenario Considering Additional Capacity for Belgium in Northsea</h1>
    <p class="mb-6">This sensitivity scenario is based on sufficiency scenario by considering additional offshore wind capacity for Belgium (8GW by 2040 & 8GW by 2050) in the North Sea. In addition to existing plannings of increasing Belgium offshore capacity to 8 GW, up to 16 GW of extra capacity is also considered in some scenarios of Energyville in the  wider North Sea area. However, the current Federal Development Plan only includes 3.5 GW additional offshore capacity.</p>
