cumulative_emissions_sce: <p>This plot represents the total cumulative emissions comparison from 2020-2050 between the optimised scenarios. Although both scenarios follow the same trajectory, the gross residual emissions are significantly higher in the reference scenario, which imposes the use of negative emissions technologies such as DACCS or BECCS.</p>

annual_costs_sce: <p>This bar chart represents the total annual costs comparison between the optimised scenarios. This costs include investment and operational costs.</p>

investment_costs_sce: <p>Comaprison of annual investment costs are shown here, representing capital investments in energy infrastructure and technologies.</p>

cumu_investment_costs_sce: <p>Comaprison of cummulative investment costs are shown here, showing the total capital investment required for the whole transition period from 2023-2050.</p>

capacities_sce: <p>The capacities chart shows the comparison of maximum production capacity for each energy source within the country at the end of transition period (2050) comapred to the capacities which were in the year 2020.</p>

storage_capacities_sce: <p>This chart displays the comparison of storage capacities available for various energy resources in year 2050 and what was the storage capacities in 2020.</p><p>Some key insights from the results include:</p><ul><li> District heating will rely heavily on seasonal storage, utilizing Thermal Energy Storage (TES) to efficiently manage heat supply across different seasons.</li><li> The TES is modeled as large water tanks, with each unit featuring a storage volume of 70,000 cubic meters and an energy storage capacity of 4,500 MWh. An example of this technology is the TES facility in HÃ¸je Taastrup, Denmark.</li><li> The optimised TES energy storage capacity is high in sufficiency scenario, as no carbon capture is allowed due to which it highly relies on green technologies.
