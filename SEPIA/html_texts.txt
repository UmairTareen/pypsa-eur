BE_cumulative_emissions_sce: <p>This plot represents the total cumulative emissions comparison from 2020-2050 between the optimised scenarios. Although both scenarios follow the same trajectory, the gross residual emissions are significantly higher in the reference scenario, which imposes the use of negative emissions technologies such as DACCS or BECCS.</p><p>The comparison of cumulative emissions reveals significant differences across scenarios:</p><ul><li> In the sufficiency scenario, cumulative emissions from the industry sector are reduced by 25%, highlighting the effectiveness of resource efficiency and demand reduction strategies in lowering overall emissions.</li><li>In the sufficiency scenario, cumulative transport emissions are reduced by 50%, demonstrating the impact of efficiency measures and sustainable mobility strategies.</li><li> In the sufficiency scenario, cumulative emissions from the residential and tertiary sectors are higher. In contrast, the reference scenario requires heavy heat pump deployment from 2030 to stay within carbon budgets. Sufficiency measures and deep renovations allow continued use of fossil fuel technologies like gas boilers, with the power-to-heat ratio gradually increasing until 2050, offering a more realistic transition.</li><li>In the sufficiency scenario, a marked reduction is observed in the consumption of primary energy sources, including fossil fuels, biogas, and biomass, highlighting a shift towards more sustainable energy practices.

BE_annual_costs_sce: <p>This bar chart represents the average total annual costs comparison between the optimised scenarios. These costs encompass the average total annualised investment costs and also operational expenses incurred annually during the transition period.</p><p>The total annual costs show a 33% reduction in sufficiency scenario, the most notable differences in operational costs in sufficiency scenario comapred to reference scenario include an annual reduction of 25% in fossil gas, 33% in biogas and 12% in fossil oil costs.

BE_investment_costs_sce: <p>Comaprison of average annual investment costs are shown here, representing annualised capital investments in energy infrastructure and technologies.</p><p>The comaprison of both scenarios indicate:</p><ul><li>30% reduced investments in solar PV and 45% in wind onshore anually in sufficiency scenario.</li><li>The annual investment costs in wind offshore are equal as in both scenarios the maximum potential is utlized.</li><li>Annual reduction of 38% in power-to heat technologies, 90% in power-to-liquid technologies and 27% reduction in power-to-gas technologies in sufficiency scenario.

BE_cumu_investment_costs_sce: <p>Comaprison of cumulative investment costs are shown here, showing the total capital investment required for the whole transition period from 2020-2050. In the sufficiency scenario, cumulative investments for Belgium are 35% lower than in the reference scenario.</p>

BE_capacities_sce: <p>The capacities chart shows the comparison of maximum production capacity for each energy source within the country at the end of transition period (2050) comapred to the capacities which were in the year 2020.</p><p>Notable insights from results include:</p><ul><li>The Sufficiency Scenario significantly reduces solar PV and onshore wind capacities, leading to lower land and material use while enabling a more flexible and adoptable deployment rate.</li><li>Transmission lines play a vital role in enhancing system flexibility and ensuring efficient energy distribution in both scenarios.</li><li>No new investments in nuclear, while only small capacities of CCGT are needed by 2050 to maintain system flexibility.</li><li> While electrification increases across various sectors, sufficiency measures play a crucial role in reducing the over burden on the electricity network.

BE_storage_capacities_sce: <p>This chart displays the comparison of storage capacities available for various energy resources in year 2050 and what was the storage capacities in 2020.</p><p>Some key insights from the results include:</p><ul><li> District heating will rely heavily on seasonal storage, utilizing Thermal Energy Storage (TES) to efficiently manage heat supply across different seasons.</li><li> The TES is modeled as large water tanks, with each unit featuring a storage volume of 70,000 cubic meters and an energy storage capacity of 4,500 MWh. An example of this technology is the TES facility in <a href="https://api.euroheat.org/uploads/PTES_in_Hoje_Taastrup_4ddf2bc6a3.pdf" target="_blank">HÃ¸je Taastrup, Denmark.</a></li><li> The optimised TES energy storage capacity is high in sufficiency scenario, as no carbon capture is allowed due to which it highly relies on green technologies. 

BE_cc_capacities_sce: <p>This chart displays the comparison of carbon capture and sequestration capacities required for each scenario compared to 2020.</p><p>Some key insights from the results include:</p><ul><li> The Reference scenario demands significant investments in carbon capture and sequestration technologies to achieve the necessary carbon reduction, indicating a heavy reliance on technological advancements and infrastructure development for large-scale emissions reduction.</li><li> The Sufficiency scenario, in contrast, necessitates fewer carbon capture and no sequestration efforts, reflecting a more balanced approach.</a></li><li> The technology and market readiness level of Direct Air Capture (DAC) and other carbon capture technologies is still evolving, with many requiring further technological development and scaling before becoming commercially viable. Additionally, the geographic suitability for large-scale sequestration projects such as specific regions with ideal geological conditions for storing carbon plays a crucial role. Investments in both the technological infrastructure and geographic sites is necessary to ensure the successful implementation of these carbon capture and sequestration options, particularly in the Reference scenario where significant carbon capture and sequestration capacities are required.

BE_energy_ind_sce: <p>This chart displays the Belgium energy inddependence achieved in the reference and sufficiency scenarios compared to 2020. The nuclear powerplants generation capacity is considered locally produced although the nuclear fuel is generally imported.</p><p>Some key insights from the results include:</p><ul><li> The energy independence of Belgium is 60% in the sufficiency scenario compared to 49% and 27% in the reference scenario and 2020 respectively.</li><li> The amount of energy imports in the sufficiency scenario is reduced more than 100% compared to the reference scenario.</a></li><li> The carrier change in total energy imports show a shift towards hydrogen backbone and increased electrification without the need of fossil fuel imports for Belgium in the sufficiency scenario.
